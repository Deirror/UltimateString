# ultimate_string

(Special Deirror's Library -> SDL)

Pissed off from trying to understand C++ strings? Here is the ultimate string, which has most of the string methods and it's just a simplified version (more understandable for begginers) of std::string + some other methods.

It's written in Microsoft style (a little confusing, but at the same time organized lol)
