# ultimate_string

(Special Deirror's Library -> SDL)

Pissed off from trying to understand C++ strings? Here is the ultimate string, which has most of the string methods and it's just a simplified version (more understandable for begginers) of std::string + some other methods.

Just add these files to the "include" folder of your compiler and you are ready to go!
